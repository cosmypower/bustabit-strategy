# bustabit-strategy

## This algorithm uses the Fibonacci sequence and bets until it cashouts at 3.00x, having a cooldown for 2 rounds. Note that is not a way to win 100% of cases but it's better to play with a strategy than manual. I've started with 100 bits and finally had 10000 bits and lost them. Everything it is luck based. 

* use tampermonkey to run this script.
* if it won't work anymore create an issue and I will optimise it.
